# IOT enabled Decentralized Waste Management using IOTA.


## Abstract

#### IOT is a very powerful tool, but on it’s own

#### its applications are very restricted.

#### Connecting different IOT enabled devices

#### using next generation blockchains like

#### Tangle. Currently numerous dustbins

#### across cities lie unused or not used in an

#### efficient manner. Our product connects

#### each of them enabling an entire ecosystem

#### of dustbins where they can efficiently

#### manage waste, identify users and reward

#### them, earn, do transactions, etc.

```
Blockchain + IOT = IOTA
```

## Introduction

### Why using Dustbin?

```
If an object like dustbin which isn’t associated
to technology can utilize this model flawlessly
then the scope of other smart devices using this
model is beyond imagination.

```
### Why using IOTA(Tangle)?

```
As the Internet-of-Things keep expanding, the need for interoperability and sharing of resources
become a necessity. IOTA enables companies to explore new business-2-business models by making
every technological resource a potential service to be traded on an open market in real time, with no
fees. In this new autonomous Machine Economy IOTA will be the backbone. The Tangle ledger is able to
settle transactions with zero fees so devices can trade exact amounts of resources on-demand, as well
as store data from sensors and data loggers securely and verified on the ledger.

```


## Proposed System:

1. Users register on the website/app.
2. They are shown their profile along with the nearest dustbins.
3. The dustbin detects every time they dispose waste in it.
4. Points are added into their account which they can later redeem for
    coupons.
5. Dustbin can analyze data and rent or buy other dustbins securely using
    IOTA for itself.
6. Dustbin sends a request to empty itself once it passes a certain
    threshold.
7. Dustbin earns points every time it is emptied which it can use to
    buy/rent other dustbins.
8. Users can set up their own dustbins.


## Tech Stack

1. NodeJs
2. OpenCV
3. IOTA

## Showstoppers

#### 1. Completely autonomous, efficient waste management

#### 2. Promoting users to properly dispose recyclable waste

#### 3. Tamper free model using the next generation blockchain Tangle.

#### 4. Unlimited applications with this modular and adaptive system.

#### 5. Real-time data which can be used in all kinds of analysis
